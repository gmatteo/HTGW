# HighThroughputGW
Package for automatic GW calculations using abinit

dependencies
------------
The main dependence of HTGW is [abipy](https://github.com/abinit/abipy/ "AbiPy git repository"). HTGW does not introduce further dependencies that are not already a dependecy of AbiPy.

preparation
-----------
In order to prepare automatic gw flows through the abipy machinery, the manager.yml needs to be present and properly configured. The abipy package provides a long list of [examples](https://github.com/abinit/abipy/tree/master/abipy/data/managers "AbiPy manager examples"). 

usage
-----

Further details are provided in [Automation methodologies and large-scale validation for GW: Towards high-throughput GW calculations](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.96.155207).
